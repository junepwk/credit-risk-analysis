# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
Several models were implemented to perform the credit risk analysis since credit risk is prone to have unbalanced classification problem. 
Libraries used:
- imbalanced-learn
- scikit-learn

Models used:
- Oversampling with RandomOverSampler & SMOTE
- Undersampling with ClusterCentroids
- Combinatorial of over- and undersampling with SMOTEEN
- BalancedRandomForestClassifier & EasyEnsembleClassifier to predict credit risk
